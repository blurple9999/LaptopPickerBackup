# Our Mission
Our Website(LaptopPicker) can provide a list of all purchasable laptops across all vendors and gives a multitude of filter options, from choosing the specific CPU, to things like how many USB/Thunderbolt ports it has, and provides several links for purchasing options (i.e. Amazon, bestbuy, straight from the manufacturers website, etc.) We think that will help user to get the perfect laptop in least amount of time. They also can search for their desired laptops.
